Three console applications to demonstrate different aspects of object-oriented programming.

_In this project I demonstrated three different ways that object can be initiated and how the main method can access them._

- Created all classes in one file for the inheritance tasks
- Created top-level classes for abstraction.
- Created all classes in the main method for interface.

`Different ways were employed to access these files in the main method.`
